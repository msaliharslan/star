Mission 1) COMPLETED
    #1 Find rotation and transformation matrices between two fisheye cameras from known 3D object(chessboard). CHECK
    #2 Find rotation and transformation matrices between two fisheye cameras from given intel matrices. CHECK
    Compare the two. CHECK

Mission 2) COMPLETED
    #1 Undistort and find checkerboard on fisheye images
    
Mission 3) COMPLETED
    #1 Find out how to use extrinsic calibration parameters
    
Mission 4) COMPLETED
    #1 By using two fisheye images and the chessboard corner detections from those estimate the Rotation and Translation between them

Mission 5) COMPLETED
    #1 Find extrinsics between RGB and Fisheye
    
Mission 6)
    #1 confirm circular tranformations are identity
    #2 using extrinsics map depth onto RGB(?)
    #3 using extrinsics map depth-rgb onto fisheye (recreate fisheye with color pixels)
